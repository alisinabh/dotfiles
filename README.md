# Alisinabh Dotfiles

This is **My Personal** preference configurations for `zsh`, `vim`, `terminator` and `tmux`.

But you can pick what you liked from it :)

Installations scripts and some configurations are highly inspired by [nicknisi/dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles)

## Installation

Copy and paste the following to any terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/alisinabh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install.sh
```
